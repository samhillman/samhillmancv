*CENNAD Lichen Apprentice Scheme, Plantlife Wales*
May 2016 – Present

Awarded two-year CENNAD Lichen Apprenticeship. Working with
lichenologists to learn the full range of skills needed to carry out
site surveys, including detailed microscopy work, ID skills and chemical
reaction tests, to identify the full range of taxa occurring in Wales
(over 1500), and advise on management of lichen species and assemblages.

June 2016 – June 2017

Working on citizen science and community engagement projects (including
In the Eyes of the Animal virtual reality experience) and land
management activities throughout Cardiff.


*Research Assistant, Bag And Remove in Cymru (BARC)*

BARC is a Cardiff University citizen science project analysing parasite
distribution in UK soil samples. I used microscopy and ID skills to
assess *Toxacara* species prevalence.


*Post-Mortem and Archival Assistant, The Otter Project*
September 2015 – June 2016

The Otter Project is a Cardiff University, Environment Agency-funded
long-term environmental surveillance scheme using deceased otters to
study population biology and disease in UK otter populations. I worked
with researchers, making observations and dissecting organ samples which
were used for further research, storing new samples in long-term storage
and retrieving up to ten-year old samples used for specific PhD research
projects.


*British Ecology Society (BES) Summer School*
July 2016

One of only 50 undergraduates competitively selected from the UK (and
the only undergraduate from Wales) for the BES Summer School. Working in
teams to investigate a variety of topics, including animal behaviour,
marine ecology, botany and entomology.


*Research Assistant, Open Air Laboratories (OPAL)*
February 2016 – April 2016

Lichen ecologist surveying lichen distribution as an indicator of air
quality near Aberthaw power station, using the OPAL (Open Air
Laboratories) and APIS (Air Pollution Information Systems) standard
methodologies.

February 2015 – Present

Working on creating pollinator habitats in Cardiff. Includes basic
selecting and surveying of potential sites and training on how to
provide key needs of pollinators, as well as planting new sites.

**Research Projects**

*Investigating the effect of temperature on the in vitro growth rate of
the oomycete *Saprolegnia parasitica**

July 2017 - September 2017

Focused on samples from Welsh salmonid species and worked with Salmon
and Brown Trout. ImageJ used for automatic and manual image processing
and R for data analysis. Wrote macros for automatic image analysis and
used R/Tidyverse for data processing and analysis. Funded research
placement working in the CRIPES (Cardiff Research in Infection and
Parasites in Ecological Systems) lab under Emily Matthews and Dr Amy
Ellison.

*Analysing the effect of temperature on invertebrate assemblage
composition, using the Porth yr Ogof cave system as a natural
temperature regulator*

June 2017

Analysis consisted of multivariate analysis of species abundance using
the mvabund R package
(<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mvabund/index.html>) to test
for changes in assemblage composition due to temperature and non-metric
Multidimensional scaling using vegan
(<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/index.html>).

Data showed significant assemblage composition change, but as this is a
limited survey further work would need to be done (as habitat type and
preference is likely to have a large effect).
